When I was being tortured, I once visited a girl friend with my soul. She was attracted to the bear and told me how she was full of love. So i visited her as a bear, and her soul was happy. She wasn't lying. I was a big giant fluffy bear, for her. She squeezed on me and loved me. And, normally, I will rip anyone to pieces that I can find.
